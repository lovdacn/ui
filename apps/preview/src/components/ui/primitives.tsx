/**
 * primitives — host indirection layer for lovdaCN. [MOTION-AWARE VARIANT]
 *
 * Installed by `lovdacn add motion`, replacing the plain variant. Because every
 * component renders its host from this file, swapping this one file upgrades the
 * whole library: `animate` / `activeAnimate` now work everywhere, with no changes
 * to the components themselves.
 *
 * Components keep importing exactly the same names:
 *
 *   import { Pressable, View, Text, TextInput } from '@/components/ui/primitives';
 *
 * These hosts are engine-backed (see `@/components/ui/motion`): animations run on
 * the UI thread, user handlers are composed rather than replaced, refs resolve to
 * the underlying host, and system reduced-motion is respected by default.
 *
 * Hosts are intentionally generic — they apply no default animation. Each component
 * owns its own default (e.g. Button passes `activeAnimate ?? 'press'`).
 *
 * ## What these hosts guarantee
 *
 * - **No motion, no cost.** With no `animate` / `activeAnimate` configured (or with them set
 *   to `false`), the host renders the RAW React Native component: no Reanimated hooks, shared
 *   values, animated style or effects. Adding a motion prop switches to the animated host.
 * - **Visible by default.** Entrance animations only start hidden where a hidden first frame
 *   cannot be mistaken for missing content (native, and web mounts after page load). Static
 *   web output, hydration and reduced motion always render final, visible values.
 * - **Canonical state routing.** A shorthand `activeAnimate` target follows the host: press
 *   for `Pressable`, focus for `TextInput`, semantic (`motionActive`) for `View` / `Text`.
 * - **Explicit style ownership.** Motion owns the whole `transform` array once it animates any
 *   transform key, composing static operations from the `style` prop in front of its own.
 *   Colors and `borderRadius` are never invented: they animate only when both an idle and an
 *   active endpoint are supplied.
 *
 * The full contract lives in the header of `@/components/ui/motion`.
