/**
 * Skeleton — loading placeholder.
 *
 * ONE implementation for preview and registry (this previously drifted: preview used the
 * CSS class while the published registry shipped a hand-rolled Reanimated loop).
 *
 * Exactly ONE system owns the pulse at a time:
 * - `animate` omitted → the `animate-pulse` class owns it. Works with zero animation
 *   runtime, so a project that never installs motion still gets a pulsing skeleton.
 * - `animate` supplied (e.g. `"pulse"` or a custom config) → the motion engine owns it and
 *   the class is dropped, so the two never animate opacity simultaneously. Reduced motion
 *   is then handled by the engine.
 * - `animate={false}` → no pulse at all; a static placeholder.
